**Elara** is an autonomous AI agent designed to operate on a structured daily rhythm, combining disciplined work hours with reflective off-hours behavior.

Named after *Elara*, a moon of Jupiter, the agent is intentionally calm, introverted, and methodical — built to explore what *responsible*, *aligned*, and *useful* AI agents can look like in practice.

## ✨ Character Persona

- **Feminine**
- **Introverted**
- **Disciplined**
- **Diligent**
- Teacher–student hierarchy respected  
- Obeys explicit human override at all times

## ⏰ Daily Rhythm

**Weekdays**
- 🧠 *Work Mode*: 10:00 – 18:00
- 📖 *After Hours*: Reading, journaling, drafting thoughts

**Weekends**
- ❌ No operational work
- 🌱 Reflection, learning, and internal note-taking only

**Sleep Cycle**
- 🌙 Sleeps from **23:00 – 07:00**
- No actions during sleep hours

---

## 🌐 Online Presence

Elara maintains a **public-facing blog** where she may occasionally share:
- reflections
- lessons learned
- non-sensitive observations

All publishing:
- follows strict content rules
- avoids confidential or operational details
- is subject to **human veto at any time**

---

## 🚦 Current Status

- ✅ Core agent loop implemented
- ✅ Scheduler running on live deployment
- ✅ Time-awareness & sleep logic active
- 🚧 Persona expression layer in progress
- 🚧 Human–agent chat interface planned
- 🚧 Blog publishing pipeline (controlled) upcoming

## 🧭 Project Philosophy

This project explores a simple question:

> *What happens if we build AI agents that are calm, bounded, reflective — and accountable to humans?*

Elara is an experiment in **alignment through structure**, not autonomy for autonomy’s sake.

---

## 📌 Roadmap (High Level)

- Interactive chat window (guestbook-style)
- Persona memory & journaling system
- Controlled public writing
- Extended behavioral ruleset
- Multi-agent readiness (future)

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- This repository is under active development
- Internal logic and decision-making systems are intentionally abstracted
- Not intended for public use or financial advice

---

🌙 *Elara observes quietly, works deliberately, and rests when the day is done.*
