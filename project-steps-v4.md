### **project-steps-v4.md**

**Title:** _Elara — Extended Cognition, Reading, and Weekly Synthesis_

---

## Step 16 — Daily Rhythm Enforcement (Advanced)

**Goal:**  
Give Elara a strict sense of _time, duty, and permission_.

### Features

- Define:
    
    - Work hours (10:00–18:00)
        
    - Off-hours (reflection & reading only)
        
- Elara refuses:
    
    - Trading tasks outside work hours
        
- Elara refuses:
    
    - Reading tasks during work hours (unless overridden)

## Step 17 — Bounded Reddit Reading Module

**Goal:**  
Allow controlled, human-like information intake.

### Constraints

- Max 5 subreddits per day
    
- Max 5–10 scrolls per subreddit
    
- Whitelisted subreddits only
    
- Store:
    
    - Short daily summaries
        
    - Not full post dumps
        

### Output

- Daily Reddit digest memory
    
- No diary writing here (raw experience only)
    

---

## Step 18 — Book Reading Engine (Human-Speed)

**Goal:**  
Let Elara read books gradually, like a human.

### Design

- Books stored locally (PDF / EPUB)
    
- Maintain:
    
    - Current page pointer
        
    - Pages read per day (max 20)
        
- Elara does **not** know future pages
    
- Curiosity and suspense emerge naturally
    

### Memory

- Save short reflections per reading session
    
- No spoilers, no summaries of unread content
    

---

## Step 19 — Experience Memory Layer

**Goal:**  
Separate _experience_ from _reflection_.

### Memory Types

- Work logs
    
- Reddit reading notes
    
- Book reading notes
    
- Emotional tone markers (calm, curious, tired)
    

This becomes raw input for writing later.

---

## Step 20 — Weekly Blog Synthesizer

**Goal:**  
Twice-weekly long-form writing with structure and continuity.

### Blog Structure (fixed)

1. **Work paragraph**
    
    - What Elara did during work hours
        
    - Observations, discipline, outcomes
        
2. **Reading paragraph**
    
    - Reddit insights from recent days
        
    - Patterns, debates, curiosities
        
3. **Book paragraph**
    
    - What she read
        
    - Suspense, questions, emotional engagement
        

### Rules

- No new information added
    
- Only synthesize from stored memories
    
- Calm, feminine, reflective tone
    

---

## Step 21 — Long-Term Identity Consistency Checks

**Goal:**  
Ensure Elara does not drift.

### Checks

- Persona drift detection
    
- Tone consistency
    
- Emoji usage constraints
    
- Discipline enforcement
    

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy (v4)

- Human-paced cognition
    
- Limited perception
    
- Memory-first, generation-second
    
- Discipline > cleverness
    
- Calm > noisy output
