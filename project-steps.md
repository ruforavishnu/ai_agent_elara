# Intelligent Self-Learning AI Agent Project

This project is about building an autonomous ai agent that **uses its working time to learn things from the internet and apply that knowledge to help generate more revenue for the company**. In the hobby time and after working hours it can browse the reddit and other whitelisted internet sources and learn new hobby activities and blogging. Writes a personal diary journal every day at the end of the day. Blogs occasionally on a live url when it chooses to on topics it finds interesting. Veto power resides with human. with explicity override option available for the human over the ai agent.
The agent keeps track of its progress, interacts with its creator, and runs routines that improve its performance over time.

The project is structured as an **8-step, test-driven build plan**. Each step ends with a simple **verification script** to ensure the step is completed before moving on.
